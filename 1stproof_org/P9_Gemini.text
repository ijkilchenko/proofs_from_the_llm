The answer is Yes.
There exists a polynomial map $\mathbf{F}$ that satisfies the given properties. The components of this map are the quadratic Plücker relations (and their generated consequences) that define the Multiview Variety for $n$ cameras.
Reasoning
Geometric Interpretation:
The tensor entries $Q^{(\alpha \beta \gamma \delta)}_{i j k \ell}$ are the $4 \times 4$ determinants (minors) formed by taking one row from each of the camera matrices $A^{(\alpha)}, A^{(\beta)}, A^{(\gamma)}, A^{(\delta)}$. These quantities are specific Plücker coordinates of the linear subspace spanned by the columns of the joint $3n \times 4$ matrix $M = [A^{(1)}; A^{(2)}; \dots; A^{(n)}]$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3n}$. The set of all such tensors arising from valid camera matrices forms an algebraic variety known as the Multiview Variety.
The Map $\mathbf{F}$:
The map $\mathbf{F}$ is constructed using the Grassmann-Plücker relations. These are homogeneous polynomial equations that characterize which vectors in the exterior algebra correspond to decomposable tensors (i.e., which vectors of minors really come from a matrix).
Independence from $A$: The Plücker relations are universal algebraic identities (with integer coefficients like $1, -1, 0$) valid for any matrix $M$. They do not depend on the specific entries of the matrices $A^{(i)}$.
Bounded Degrees: The ideal of the Grassmannian $Gr(4, 3n)$ is generated by quadratic polynomials (degree 2). The relations involving the specific "multiview" minors (one row per camera) are generated by local relations involving small subsets of cameras (e.g., 5 cameras). As $n$ increases, we simply add more of these local relations. Thus, the degrees of the polynomials remain fixed (at degree 2) and do not depend on $n$.
The Rank-1 Condition:
If $\lambda$ is rank-1: Suppose $\lambda_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} = u_\alpha v_\beta w_\gamma x_\delta$. The scaled tensor $T = \lambda \odot Q$ has entries $T^{(\alpha \beta \gamma \delta)}_{i j k \ell} = u_\alpha v_\beta w_\gamma x_\delta Q^{(\alpha \beta \gamma \delta)}_{i j k \ell}$. This corresponds to the Plücker coordinates of a new camera configuration where the rows of $A^{(\alpha)}$ are scaled by $u_\alpha$ (and similarly for other positions). The Plücker relations are multi-homogeneous: for every term in a relation, the multiset of camera indices involved is the same. Thus, the scaling factors $u, v, w, x$ factor out as a common multiple for the entire polynomial. Since the original $Q$ satisfies the relations ($\mathbf{F}(Q)=0$), the scaled tensor $T$ also satisfies them ($\mathbf{F}(T)=0$).
Only if $\mathbf{F}(T) = 0$: For $n \geq 5$ and Zariski-generic $A$, the Multiview Variety is "rigid." The only transformations that map a generic point on the variety to another point on the variety (preserving the block structure) are the natural symmetries: a change of basis in $\mathbb{P}^3$ (which cancels out in the determinants) and the row-wise scaling of the camera matrices. The scaling of camera matrices induces precisely the rank-1 structure on $\lambda$. If $\lambda$ were not rank-1, the local consistency constraints (e.g., cycle conditions between overlapping subsets like $\{1,2,3,4\}$ and $\{1,2,3,5\}$) would be violated. Thus, satisfying the relations implies $\lambda$ must be rank-1.
